# Brain_tumor_detection_from_2D_MRI_images

In this project we are handling a binary classification problem of distributing 2D MRI images into 2 classes : tumor vs non-tumor.

## tools and technologies

The whole project is done in google colab using ***python*** as programming language.

Here is the list of libraries used in this project:

1. Tensorflow and keras ( For deep learning CNN architecture and transfer learning)
2. Opencv (image preprocessing)
3. Scikit-image (image preprocessing)
4. scikit-learn(Machine Learning)

The weights of the model used are saved [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11VBQUV_LAZXhA7o-mHNJrQ_0JIdQDcyl/view?usp=sharing)

## N.B.

Sometimes it's possible the notebooks are not shown or asking to reload, to use these notebooks just download and open with anconda jupyter or any software that supports .ipynb file

or just download it and upload to google colab from your local drive to use these.
